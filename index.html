        <h3>GOAL SETTING</h3>
        <p>Goal setting is a powerful process for thinking about your ideal future, and for motivating yourself to turn your vision of this future into reality. The process of setting goals helps you choose where you want to go in life. By knowing precisely what you want to achieve, you know where you have to concentrate your efforts. You will also quickly spot the distractions that can, so easily, lead you astray. Goals are more deliberate than desires and momentary intentions. Therefore, setting goals means that a person has committed thought, emotion, and behavior towards attaining the goal.</p>

        <h3>SELF-CARE IDEAS</h3>
        <p>For some, that can mean taking care of your physical health by going on a walk, eating nutritious foods, getting enough sleep or simply making sure you are able to fit in a shower each day. For others, it can mean nurturing your mental health with daily meditation sessions, practicing a hobby you love or connecting with friends and family. And, in some cases, it can even mean setting healthy boundaries by giving yourself permission to turn down invitations to certain activities or to stop engaging in a negative relationship. There is no one right way to practice self-care, it can take on a variety of forms depending on what you like and what you need.</p>
